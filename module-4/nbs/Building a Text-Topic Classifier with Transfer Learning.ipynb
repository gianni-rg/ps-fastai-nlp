       "\n",
       " xxmaj many atheists feel that the idea of xxmaj god as presented by the major religions \n",
       " is essentially self - contradictory , and that it is logically impossible that \n",

       " xxmaj those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of xxmaj god \n",

       "\n",
       " xxmaj one of the most common xxunk in philosophical discussion is \" the \n",
